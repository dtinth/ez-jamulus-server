# ez-jamulus-server

Automated script to install a headless Jamulus server on a Debian cloud VM, created for people who have little to no Linux administration knowledge.

With this script, one can set up a headless Jamulus server on a cloud instance by running a single command. Server settings can be changed without using a text editor.
